 * The attributes for the wrapper around a trigger and a tooltip bubble.
 *
 * The bubble shows on hover and on focus. The focus part is not optional: a
 * bubble that only comes with the mouse does not exist for keyboard users.
 *
 * The text in the bubble must be connected to the trigger with
 * `aria-describedby`. Without it the bubble is just something that appears
 * on screen, and is never announced.
 *
 * Use it for something extra, never for something the user must have. On a
 * touch screen there is neither hover nor focus before something is tapped.
 *
 * ```ts
 * <span {...tooltip()}>
 *   <button aria-describedby="hint">Archive</button>
 *   <span class={tooltip.bubble} role="tooltip" id="hint">Moves it to the archive</span>
 * </span>
 * ```
