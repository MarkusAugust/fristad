/**
 * A modal dialog a server can open.
 *
 * Opening a `<dialog>` is a call and not an attribute. `showModal()` moves
 * focus in, keeps focus inside the dialog, closes on Escape and makes the rest
 * of the page inert. `<dialog open>` does none of that: it is a box on the
 * page.
 *
 * A server that only sends HTML cannot call anything. Without this component
 * an app in Datastar, htmx or a Go template could not open a dialog at all
 * without writing a script of its own alongside. Here the server says instead
 * that the dialog is open, and the component makes the call.
 *
 * When the user closes the dialog, with Escape or with a button in a
 * `<form method="dialog">`, `open` is removed from the host again, so the
 * markup says the same as the screen. The component reports it with
 * `dialog-toggle`, which carries `open` and `returnValue`. A click on the
 * backdrop does not close it: neither does it on a plain `<dialog>`, and the
 * component adds nothing.
 *
 * `open` on the **host** comes from the server. If the server sends the
 * region again with `open` still set, the dialog opens again. `open` on the
 * `<dialog>` itself comes from the browser, set by `showModal()`, and the
 * component puts it back when a patch removes it. The template needs no
 * `data-preserve-attr`.
 *
 * Write `open` on the `<dialog>` itself too when the dialog should be shown.
 * Without JavaScript a `<dialog>` without `open` is hidden, and then the
 * content does not exist at all. `lt.dialog({ open: true })` gives both.
 *
 * `server-controlled` on the host turns off the repair of `open` on the
 * `<dialog>`. Then every patch decides whether the dialog is shown, also when
 * it is in the top layer.
 *
 * ```html
 * <lt-dialog open>
 *   <dialog class="lt-dialog" aria-labelledby="title" open>
 *     <h2 class="lt-dialog__title" id="title">The decision is registered</h2>
 *     <div class="lt-dialog__body">The case has been processed.</div>

 *     </form>

/**
 * The dialogs already checked for a close before upgrade.
 *
 * The check applies only the first time a dialog is seen, not every time a
 * host is connected. A morph that moves the host disconnects and reconnects
 * it, and then `returnValue` was left over from a close the user made long
 * ago. The component thought it had been closed before the script arrived,
