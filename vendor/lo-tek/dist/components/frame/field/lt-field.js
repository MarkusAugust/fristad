 * attributes instead, and this element is not needed.

 *
 * The template writes what HTML requires for the field to work without
 * JavaScript: `for` on the label and `id` on the control, or the label
 * wrapping the control. The component writes the rest: the ids of the help
 * text and the error text, `aria-describedby`, `aria-invalid` and the
 * classes. If a morph removes them, the component sees it and sets them back.
 *
 * The component never writes an id on the control. Datastar and idiomorph
 * recognise a node by its id, and a control with an id the server did not
 * send is replaced on the next update, along with focus and what the user
 * has typed.
 *
 * The field is invalid when the error text is visible, that is when it has
 * no `hidden`, or when the server has written `aria-invalid` on the control.
 * There is no separate state on the host: a template renders the error text
 * when the field is invalid, and client code toggles `hidden`.
