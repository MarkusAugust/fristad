/**
 * Keyboard behaviour in a tab list, and the wiring when the markup comes

 *
 * The tabs are links to their panels, the way GOV.UK does it:
 *
 * ```html
 * <lt-tabs>
 *   <ul class="lt-tabs__list" aria-label="Parts of the case">
 *     <li><a href="#application">Application</a></li>
 *     <li><a href="#attachments">Attachments</a></li>
 *   </ul>
 *   <section class="lt-tabs__panel" id="application"><h2>Application</h2>…</section>
 *   <section class="lt-tabs__panel" id="attachments"><h2>Attachments</h2>…</section>
 * </lt-tabs>
 * ```
 *
 * Without JavaScript this is a table of contents with all the panels one
 * after another, and the links work. What the template writes is an id on
 * the panels, and it needs the links anyway.
 *
 * The web component never writes an id on a tab or a panel. Datastar and
 * idiomorph recognise an element by its id, and an element with an id the
 * server did not send is replaced at the next update, along with the tab
 * selection and focus. The panels' ids come from the server, so they are
 * kept. What the web component fills in, it computes from the markup: the
 * roles, `aria-controls` from `href`, `role="presentation"` on the list
 * items, and the panel's name, which is the tab's. The heading in the panel
 * is the name when it says the same as the tab. Only the selected panel is a
 * tab stop.
 *
 * The panels that are not selected are hidden with `hidden="until-found"`, so
 * find in page and a link to something in a panel reach them, and the
 * browser fires `beforematch`, which the web component selects the tab from.
 * If the server wrote `hidden` itself, it is written back in the server's
 * form, across the whole tab list: `lt.tabs()` from
 * `@lo-tek/interfaces/react` gives `hidden=""`, because React cannot write
 * `until-found`. The address selects the tab when the page loads and when it
 * changes, and each selection is written to the address, unless it already
 * points to the selected panel or something in it. On load the server's
 * `aria-selected` comes before the address, and under `server-controlled`
 * the address never selects.
 *
 * What the server has written stays. Which tab is selected is read from
 * `aria-selected`, and when that is missing, from which panel is not hidden;
 * if nothing is said, it is the first. Before the web component is
 * registered, `tabs.css` shows only the panel the web component is going to
 * select: the first visible one, or the one the address points to, so the
 * content does not jump when the rest are hidden.
 *
 * What the web component then does is what the browser does not do by
 * itself: Tab skips past the whole tab list and into the panel, while the
 * arrow keys move between the tabs. With `activation="manual"` the arrow keys
 * only move focus, and Enter or Space selects.
 *
 * The tab selection belongs to the user, and the web component restores it
 * when a patch strips it. If the server needs to move the tab, as in
 * "continue to step 2", set `server-controlled` on the host, and then every
 * patch decides.
