/**
 * A panel that hangs below a button, and closes itself.
 *
 * The panel uses the browser's own `popover`, so it goes into the top layer
 * and lies above everything else without `z-index`. `lt.popover()` writes
 * `popover="manual"`, so Escape and clicks outside are handled by the
 * component: with `auto` the browser closed the panel before the button got
 * its click, and the button could not be used to close it again. Handwritten
 * markup with a bare `popover` is `auto`, and then the component follows along
 * when the browser closes it.
 *
 * What the top layer does not do is place the panel. `position-anchor` is not
 * yet in every browser, so the position is worked out here.
 *
 * When the markup is made with JavaScript, `lt.popover()` writes the wiring:
 * `aria-controls` on the button, and the class, the id and `popover` on the
 * panel. When the markup comes from a template without JavaScript, the
 * template writes a button and a panel with the class `lt-popover` and an id:
 * the component sets `popover="manual"` and writes `aria-controls` on the
 * button from the id. Only what is missing, so what the server wrote stays.
 * The component sets `open` on the host, `aria-expanded` on the button and the
 * position on the panel, and puts back everything it has written when a patch
 * removes it. The template needs no `data-preserve-attr`.
 *
 * The component never writes an id on the panel. Datastar and idiomorph
 * recognise an element by its id, and a panel with an id the server did not
 * send was replaced on the next patch, along with focus and what the user had
 * done in it. Without an id the panel is kept, but the button cannot be
 * connected to it with `aria-controls`, and the component says so in the
 * console.
 *
 * The repair works one way: if someone has asked for the popover to be open,
 * it stays open through a patch. If the server sends `open`, it opens, since
 * that is something the server actually said.
 *
 * For the server to decide the state, set `server-controlled` on the host.
 * That is also the answer when the page controls `open` with an attribute from
 * outside, as with Datastar's `data-attr:open`: a removed attribute cannot be
 * told apart from a morph, while `menu.open = false` is a message the
 * component can see.
 *
 * ```html
 * <lt-popover placement="bottom-end">
 *   <button class="lt-button" aria-controls="menu" aria-expanded="false">Actions</button>
 *   <ul id="menu" class="lt-popover" popover="manual">…</ul>
 * </lt-popover>
 * ```

         * says it: if it goes through the property, as in `menu.open = false`,
